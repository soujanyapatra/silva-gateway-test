Constantly updated lists of world countries, territories and areas of geographical interest, with associated *alpha-2*, *alpha-3* and *numeric codes* as defined by the *ISO 3166-1* standard, published and maintained by the [International Organization for Standardization](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html), available in `CSV`, `JSON`, `PHP`, `SQL` and `XML` formats, in multiple languages and with national flags included. Also available are the ISO 3166-2 codes used for identifying the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.

In the language folders (inside `data/countries`) you will find files named in two different ways.<br>Here's what you will find in each of them:

|File names | Content |
|:---:|:---
| <a name="world"></a>*world.** | Files named like this contain all the **249** countries, territories, and areas of geographical interest that have an officially assigned *ISO 3166-1* code.
| <a name="countries"></a>*countries.** | Files named like this contain **195** entries made up from the 193 sovereign states (commonly referred to as *countries*) that are members of the [United&nbsp;Nations (UN)](https://www.un.org/about-us/member-states) plus the 2 [observer states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_observers) of *Palestine* and the *Vatican City State*.

> Note that there are 206 sovereign states in the world, the 11 states that are missing from the *countries* list being the ones having their sovereignty disputed. See the list of [sovereign states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states) with information on their status and recognition of their sovereignty.

The files contain:

- the **ISO 3166-1 numeric** country codes
- the **ISO 3166** official short names in *English*<small><sup>[1](#footnote)</sup></small>
- the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** two-letter country codes<small><sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup></small>
- the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-3** three-letter country codes<small><sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup></small>

<small><a name="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> for other languages the country names are in that particular language</small>
<br><small><a name="footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> ISO 3166-1 alpha codes are uppercase but this library provides them in lowercase</small>

The lists are currently available in **33 languages**:

- Arabic
- Armenian
- Basque
- Bulgarian
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Chinese (Traditional)
- Croatian

> The language folders are named based on the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) standard.

## ISO 3166-2 codes

The project also tries to be a comprehensive and up-to-date source for **ISO 3166-2** which defines codes for identifying the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.

The purpose of ISO 3166-2 is to establish an international standard of short and unique alphanumeric codes to represent the relevant administrative divisions and dependent territories of all countries in a more convenient and less ambiguous form than their full names. Each complete ISO 3166-2 code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen:

`US-TX` for Texas, USA

The first part is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the country;
The second part is a string of up to three alphanumeric characters, which is usually obtained from national sources and stems from coding systems already in use in the country concerned, but may also be developed by the ISO itself.
Each complete ISO 3166-2 code can then be used to uniquely identify a country subdivision in a global context.

The list is available in `CSV`, `JSON`, `PHP`, `SQL` and `XML` formats in the `data/subdivisions` folder and the CSV one looks like this:

```csv
US,US-AL,Alabama
US,US-AK,Alaska
US,US-AZ,Arizona
US,US-AR,Arkansas
US,US-CA,California
US,US-CO,Colorado
```

The starting point of this list was the ISO 3166-2 Subdivision Code list provided by [IP2Location](https://www.ip2location.com/free/iso3166-2) but this one will be maintained by the community.

```json
{"id":250,"alpha2":"fr","alpha3":"fra","name":"France"},
{"id":266,"alpha2":"ga","alpha3":"gab","name":"Gabon"},
{"id":270,"alpha2":"gm","alpha3":"gmb","name":"Gambia"},

Here's a little helper function for searching for a specific country's data

> The helper function assumes that the JSON with the countries data is associated with a variable named `countries` which is in the same scope as the function

> The helper function is to be used with the *non-combined* data sets.<br>For the *combined* data sets you can write the function yourself.

```js
//  returns an object with the sought country's data if the search yields a result
//  returns undefined if no results could be found or if argument is incorrect
function search_country(query) {

    // if argument is not valid return false
    if (undefined === query.id && undefined === query.alpha2 && undefined === query.alpha3) return undefined;

        // iterate over the array of countries
	return countries.filter(function(country) {

        // return country's data if
        return (
            // we are searching by ID and we have a match
            (undefined !== query.id && parseInt(country.id, 10) === parseInt(query.id, 10))
            // or we are searching by alpha2 and we have a match
            || (undefined !== query.alpha2 && country.alpha2 === query.alpha2.toLowerCase())
            // or we are searching by alpha3 and we have a match
            || (undefined !== query.alpha3 && country.alpha3 === query.alpha3.toLowerCase())
        )

    // since "filter" returns an array we use pop to get just the data object
    }).pop()

}
```

Usage

```js
search_country({id: 250})
search_country({alpha2: 'fr'})
search_country({alpha3: 'fra'})
```

### TypeScript

Typings are available ([source](types.d.ts)):

```ts
import { Country, LanguageCode, TranslatedCountry } from 'world_countries_lists'
```

### PHP

Excerpt from the `data/countries/en/countries.php` file:

```php
250 => array('id' => 250, 'alpha2' => 'fr', 'alpha3' => 'fra', 'name' => 'France'),
266 => array('id' => 266, 'alpha2' => 'ga', 'alpha3' => 'gab', 'name' => 'Gabon'),
270 => array('id' => 270, 'alpha2' => 'gm', 'alpha3' => 'gmb', 'name' => 'Gambia'),
```
Here's a little helper function for searching for a specific country's data

> The helper function is to be used with the *non-combined* data sets.<br>For the *combined* data sets you can write the function yourself.

```php
//  this function assumes that you have done this:
$countries = require 'path/to/countries.php';

//  returns an array with the sought country's data if the search yields a result
//  returns false if no results could be found or if argument is incorrect
function search_country($query) {

    // make the countries available in the function
    global $countries;

    // if argument is not valid return false
    if (!isset($query['id']) && !isset($query['alpha2']) && !isset($query['alpha3'])) return false;

    // iterate over the array of countries
    $result = array_filter($countries, function($country) use ($query) {

        // return country's data if
        return (
            // we are searching by ID and we have a match
            (isset($query['id']) && $country['id'] == $query['id'])
            // or we are searching by alpha2 and we have a match
            || (isset($query['alpha2']) && $country['alpha2'] == strtolower($query['alpha2']))
            // or we are searching by alpha3 and we have a match
            || (isset($query['alpha3']) && $country['alpha3'] == strtolower($query['alpha3']))
        );

    });

    // since "array_filter" returns an array we use pop to get just the data object
    // we return false if a result was not found
    return empty($result) ? false : array_pop($result);

}
```
Usage

```php
search_country(array('id' => 250));
search_country(array('alpha2' => 'fr'));
search_country(array('alpha3' => 'fra'));
```

### XML

Excerpt from the `data/countries/en/countries.xml` file:

```

## Flags

The package also contains the national flags of each country as a 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 and 128x128 PNG images. The image files are named using the ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code of the country they represent, for easily pairing flags with countries.

> Flag images are also available as single `JSON` files, one for each of the available sizes, containing all flag images as `data-uri`

## Data sources

Country names in all languages are taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).
